The sudo mesh firmware builder.

# Requirements

The openwrt wiki has some examples of requirements per distro:
http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/buildroot.exigence#examples.of.package.installations

Their example for ubuntu 64-bit is:
    sudo apt-get install build-essential subversion libncurses5-dev zlib1g-dev gawk gcc-multilib flex git-core gettext quilt ccache libssl-dev xsltproc

# Building home-node firmware

Run:

```
 ./build <arch>
```

Where arch is either ar71xx or atheros e.g:

```
./build ar71xx
```

The build will happen in:

```
built_firmware/builder.ar71xx/
```

The firmware images will be available in:

```
built_firmware/builder.ar71xx/bin/ar71xx/
```

# Building extender-node firmware

Make sure you've already built the home-node firmware as the extender-node firmware will not build otherwise.

Run:

```
./build_extender-node ar71xx
```

The build will happen in:

```
built_firmware/builder.ar71xx.extender-node/
```

The firmware images will be available in:

```
built_firmware/builder.ar71xx.extender-node/bin/ar71xx/
```
