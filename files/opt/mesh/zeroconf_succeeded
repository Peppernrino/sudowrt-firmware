Hey there! Your node was successfully configured with the MESH IP <insert-mesh-ip>

The default root and admin passwords are "meshtheplanet", but you probably already know that, since you found this file.

Be sure to change these passwords by ssh'ing into the node as root and running, 
`passwd root`
`passwd admin`

Additionally, you can add your public key to `/etc/dropbear/authorized_keys` if you prefer to log in with your ssh keys.

You should also remove the cronjob that automatically deletes the root password after a day, 
you can do this by running, `crontab -e` and deleting the line that reads "* * */1 * * rm /etc/shawdow"

P.S. this is a really hacky way of removing default root/admin access, someone should make it better!
